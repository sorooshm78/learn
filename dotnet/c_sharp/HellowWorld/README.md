Every C# file start *.cs

*.cs -> C# compiler -> *.dll

*.csproj file representing the project

dll -> Dynamic Link Library

A Dynamic Link library (DLL) is a library that contains functions and codes that can be used by more than one program at a time. 
Once we have created a DLL file, we can use it in many applications. 
The only thing we need to do is to add the reference/import the DLL File. 
Both DLL and .exe files are executable program modules but the difference is that we cannot execute DLL files directly.
