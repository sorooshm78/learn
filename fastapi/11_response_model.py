# FastAPI will use this return type to:

#     * Validate the returned data.
#         If the data is invalid (e.g. you are missing a field), it means that your app code is broken, not returning what it should, and it will return a server error instead of returning incorrect data. This way you and your clients can be certain that they will receive the data and the data shape expected.
#     * Add a JSON Schema for the response, in the OpenAPI path operation.
#         This will be used by the automatic docs.
#         It will also be used by automatic client code generation tools.

# But most importantly:

#     * It will limit and filter the output data to what is defined in the return type.
#         This is particularly important for security, we'll see more of that below.


# -----------------------------

# response_model Parameter
# There are some cases where you need or want to return some data that is not exactly what the type declares.
# For example, you could want to return a dictionary or a database object, but declare it as a Pydantic model. This way the Pydantic model would do all the data documentation, validation, etc. for the object that you returned (e.g. a dictionary or database object).
# If you added the return type annotation, tools and editors would complain with a (correct) error telling you that your function is returning a type (e.g. a dict) that is different from what you declared (e.g. a Pydantic model).
# In those cases, you can use the path operation decorator parameter response_model instead of the return type.
# You can use the response_model parameter in any of the path operations:

#     @app.get()
#     @app.post()
#     @app.put()
#     @app.delete()

# -----------------------------

# Return Type and Data Filtering
# Let's continue from the previous example. We wanted to annotate the function with one type but return something that includes more data.
# We want FastAPI to keep filtering the data using the response model.
# In the previous example, because the classes were different, we had to use the response_model parameter. But that also means that we don't get the support from the editor and tools checking the function return type.
# But in most of the cases where we need to do something like this, we want the model just to filter/remove some of the data as in this example.
# And in those cases, we can use classes and inheritance to take advantage of function type annotations to get better support in the editor and tools, and still get the FastAPI data filtering.

# Return a Response Directly


from fastapi import FastAPI, Response
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse, RedirectResponse

        return RedirectResponse(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
    return JSONResponse(content={"message": "Here's your interdimensional portal."})

# This simple case is handled automatically by FastAPI because the return type annotation is the class (or a subclass) of Response.
# And tools will also be happy because both RedirectResponse and JSONResponse are subclasses of Response,
# so the type annotation is correct.
# Annotate a Response Subclass
# You can also use a subclass of Response in the type annotation:

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse

app = FastAPI()


@app.get("/teleport")
async def get_teleport() -> RedirectResponse:
    return RedirectResponse(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")

# This will also work because RedirectResponse is a subclass of Response, and FastAPI will automatically handle this simple case.

# Invalid Return Type Annotations

# But when you return some other arbitrary object that is not a valid Pydantic type (e.g. a database object) and you annotate it like that in the function,
# FastAPI will try to create a Pydantic response model from that type annotation, and will fail.
# The same would happen if you had something like a union between different types where one or more of them are not valid Pydantic types, for example this would fail ðŸ’¥:

from fastapi import FastAPI, Response

    if teleport:
        return RedirectResponse(url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ")
    return {"message": "Here's your interdimensional portal."}

# ...this fails because the type annotation is not a Pydantic type and is not just a single Response class or subclass, it's a union (any of the two) between a Response and a dict
