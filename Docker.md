To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
(amd64)
3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
to your terminal.


Docker pull image from docker hub 
```
docker pull <image_name>
```

Show list of images
```
docker images
```

Show list containers
```
docker ps

docker ps -a # all container
```
